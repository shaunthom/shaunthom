Hey there! I'm Shaun Thomas and I'm a graduate student in Data Science at SUNY, Buffalo. An avid chess player who hates to lose, my undergraduate study was in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. I got the opportunity to work on some cool coding projects during these years. This got me into coding Arduino microcontrollers at the time. After this, I got into programming languages. I turned my attention towards data analytics ever since I got my internship role at Tata Consultancy Services. At TCS, I collaborated with a team of 8 in improving the efficacy of an auto data classifier model. I used specialized Python modules to achieve this. With my fellow interns, I was also able to design and execute an algorithm that accurately categorized national identifications of citizens of various countries. 

    For my capstone project, my team and I built an IOT-based Water Management System.
