Oh Hi there! I'm Shaun Thomas and I'm a graduate student in Data Science at SUNY, Buffalo. 

üíª I love to tell stories and tales through data using various tools

üå± I am currently learning Advanced Statistics for Data scientists

üë®‚Äçüíª Some of my projects:

RemoteReality: Visualizing the Benefits of Remote Work - A data visualization website that dives deep into the reason why people prefer offsite work over onsite work

Deep learning Chess - A robust deep learning model that accurately predicts results of a chess match based on momentum of players, quality of opposition & color assignment

IOT Water Management System - Developed a platform that reports water consumption, displays water level in sumps, automated fresh water supply & much more

Snake Robot - A surveillance device designed to monitor hazardous areas and report back findings in real-time - Won the award for Best Surveillance Device at IEEE National Tech Fest in 2021 

My Story:

An avid chess player who hates to lose, my undergraduate study was in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. 
I got the opportunity to work on some cool coding projects during these years. This got me into coding Arduino
microcontrollers at the time. After this, I got into programming languages. I turned my attention towards 
data analytics ever since I got my internship role at Tata Consultancy Services. At TCS, I collaborated 
with a team of 8 in improving the efficacy of an auto data classifier model. I used specialized Python modules
to achieve this. With my fellow interns, I was also able to design and execute an algorithm that accurately
categorized national identifications of citizens of various countries. Not long after this, I had the 
chance to work as a data analyst intern at another tech company in Kerala. I was working on SQL queries
using pandas during this time. I was also helping out with various data visualization tasks. I decided
to major in this field after these experiences. I am now studying Data Science at SUNY, Buffalo.
I am eager to collaborate on data related projects.
